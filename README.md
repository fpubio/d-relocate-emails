# d-relocate-emails
 Use PowerShell to move emails using a simple CSV file to define rules

## Usage

### The ini file

The 'ini' file can be used to configure things a bit. By default, the script searches for the ini file in the parent folder of the folder containing `d-relocate-emails.ps1`.

The sample `ini` file, `d-relocate-emails.ini`, provides a starting point for an `ini` file.


### The rules CSV file

The sample rules file, `rules.csv`, provides some examples of supported rules.
